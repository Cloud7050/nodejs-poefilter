There are a few sets of effects for how prominent items should be.

This is not necessarily tied to the item's vanilla rarity or text colour. Eg exalts can be given large size and yellow text as a *perceived* rare item, yet actual rare gear can be given medium size (which is usually blue text elsewhere).
